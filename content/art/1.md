### ComfyUI

link : https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI

Is the most powerful and modular diffusion model GUI.

#### Link to notebook : [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14EzGVMQ0tP1FXmxIuvyvRmcnDWTeW6Yu?usp=sharing)

Currently the notebook is vanilla hosting of ComfyUI, in future I plan to release more useful implementation.
