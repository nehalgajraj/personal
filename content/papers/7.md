### Notes
- Frontier models are great to raw intelligence but lack the process flow todo something end to end. 
- The paper introduces the first comprehensive framework for fully *automatic scientific discovery* aka. fully automated and scalable pipeline for end-to-end paper generation
- How it works is :
	- generates novel research ideas
	- writes code
	- executes experiments
	- visualizes results 
	- describes its finding
	- simulates review process for evaluation

### Common Failure Modes
- Idea generation process often results in very similar ideas across different runs and even models.
- [Aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider) fails to implement a significant fraction of proposed ideas.
- Did not use vision capabilities of foundation models, it is unable to fix visual issues.
- Struggles with to compare the magnitude of two numbers, which is a known pathology with LLMs

### Future Directions
- Direct enhancement could include integrating vision capabilities for better plot and figure handling.
- Expanding the framework to other scientific domains could further amplify its impact. For example, by integrating these technologies with cloud robotics and automation in physical lab spaces provided it can be done safely, the AI SCIENTIST could perform experiments for biology, chemistry, and material science.
