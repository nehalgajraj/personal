(Parallel Information Aggregation via Neural Orchestration) architecture

#### Notes
- Using PIANO, author shows' that agents form their own professional identities, obey collective rules, transmit cultural information and exert religious influence, and use sophisticated infrastructures, such as legal systems.
- Just as a pianist coordinates multiple notes to create a harmony, the PIANO architecture selectively and concurrently executes various modules in parallel to enable agents to interact with the environment in real-time.

#### Why is it hard to build AI civilizations
- *Single agents don't make progress*: LLM-powered agents often struggle to maintain a grounded sense of reality in their actions and reasoning. Even a small rate of hallucinations can poison downstream agent behavior when agents continuously interact with the environment via LM calls
- *Groups of agent's don't make progress*: Agents that miscommunicate their thoughts and intents can mislead other agents, causing them to propagate further hallucinations and loop.
- *A lack of benchmarks for civilizational progress*: There is a lack of large-scale benchmarks that can attributed to how technically difficult it is to perform simulations of hundreds or thousands of agents in a single world.
#### PIANO Architecture
- Author propose two brain-inspired design principles for the composite architecture of human-like AI agents.
- There are two main problems with agent architecture
	- Concurrency
	- Coherence
- ##### Concurrency
	- P: Agent should be able to think and act concurrently. Agent be able to interact in real time with low-latency, but also have the capacity to slowly deliberate and plan. 
	- CS: Vast majority of LLM-based agents today primarily use single-threaded, sequential functions. None are designed for concurrent programming. 
	- S: The brain solves this problem by running different modules concurrently and at different time scales. 
		- Author designed modules, such as 
			- cognition,
			- planning,
			- motor execution, 
			- and speech 
		- to run concurrently in agent brain.
		- Each module can be seen as a stateless function that reads and writes to a shared Agent State.
- ##### Coherence
	- P: An immediate challenge with concurrent modules is that they can produce independent outputs, making the agent incoherent. For instance, agents say one thing but actually do something else. 
		- Incoherence also scales exponentially as the number of independent output modules increases
	- CS: The incoherence problem is usually not obvious for sequential architectures.
		- But a significant problem when multiple output modules can interface with the environment.
	- S: To ensure that the multiple outputs produced by agent are coherent, author introduced a Cognitive Controller (CC) module that is solely responsible for making high-level deliberate decisions.

#### Cognitive Controller and Core modules
- Cognitive Controller is solely responsible for making high-level deliberate decisions. 
	- The decisions are then translated downstream to produce appropriate output in each motor module
- The Cognitive Controller synthesizes information across the Agent State through a bottleneck.
- This design of a bottlenecked decision-maker that broadcasts its outputs has been suggested as a core ingredient for human consciousness and is used in some neural network architectures.
- ##### Core Modules
	- Memory: Stores and retrieves conversations, actions, and observations across various timescales. 
	- Action Awareness: Allows agents to assess their own state and performance, enabling for moment-by-moment adjustments. 
	- Goal Generation: Facilitates the creation of new objectives based on the agentâ€™s experiences and environmental interactions.
	- Social Awareness: Enables agents to interpret and respond to social cues from other agents, supporting cooperation and communication.
	- Talking: Interprets and generates speech.
	- Skill Execution: Performs specific skills or actions within the environment.
