Emotions are a a tricky thing, you get overwhelmed by one, and the brains in balance numbs, it out. You forget you have other emotion ( why I'm talking to you). The numbness transverse thought  the day and the frequency of life stables with that buffer numbness. 

Thought experiment  ( I'm watching a scary movie, and it hit me)
Can I expand the range of emotion that i feel by stretching out the emotion space on a daily in a defined dimensions. 

I can start with what the primary emotions and how do i systematic trigger them on a daily basis.
There can be much to understand how each emotions play with another and how the action of outside world (ones i can control and ones i cannot control) effect the score board. 

The reason to explore this paradigm is a healthy range of emotion results in a higher flow on ideas and thoughts.

Maybe i can build a app  (ambition) that can be used to periodically explore and stretch the space.

To start with first i need to find how many primary emotion exist and can i remember a instance in life when i felt one prominently (as memories do have residue of emotion attached with). I can recreate the same memory or a close approximation of it to induce that specific emotion 

Based on Basic Emotions Theory by Paul Ekman there are 6 basic emotions
- Happiness
- Sadness
- Fear
- Disgust
- Anger
- Surprise

Alongside, there is Dimensional Models of Emotion ( Circumplex Model of Affect)
- Two-Dimensional Approach :
	- Valence (pleasant-unpleasant)
	- Arousal (high-low)

There is also Robert Plutchik's Whell of Emotions (we name differnt concept with distinch name of people who inductored them or contributed heavy to remember and distrill easily)

For simplicity, i'll only focus on six basic emotions as defined by Paul Ekman.
